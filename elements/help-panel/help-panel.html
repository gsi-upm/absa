        This tool consists of two parts:
        </br></br></br>

        1 - Dashboards: To get maximum performance and enjoyment to the input data and filter them have various ways. On the one hand, a written form, in which the top bar of the screen allows you to write text in natural language and collect the data analyzed. On the other hand, a filter field, this means you can click on the graphics and filter by that field, making combined searches. *
        </br></br>

        2 - SPARQL Editor: This is a text editor that lets you create queries to be asked to a specific endpoint and collect data in a table. You can choose the consultations already created or create your own typing the text box.

        </br></br></br>

        * Both searches can not be done at once, filtered by the last selected method.
